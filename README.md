## Introduction

Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic technique that uses principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication channels. This repository provides a simplified simulation of the QKD process between Alice and Bob, based on the BB84 protocol. Additionally, it includes a demonstration of constructing a quantum circuit using Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework.

## QKD Simulation

The QKD simulation consists of Python functions for generating random bit strings, encoding bits based on randomly chosen bases, transmitting them, receiving and decoding them based on the received bases, and establishing a shared key. Alice and Bob are simulated separately, and the main function orchestrates the communication between them.

## Visualization

After the QKD process, the code visualizes the steps using Matplotlib. It plots scatter plots of Alice's encoded bits and bases, and Bob's measured bits and bases. Additionally, it plots histograms of Alice's bits and bases, aiding in understanding the QKD process visually.

## Quantum Circuit Example (Qiskit)

The quantum circuit example demonstrates the construction of a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit. Various quantum gates are applied to qubits in the circuit, and then the circuit is visualized using Qiskit's visualization tools.
